        <h2 class="font-bold text-2xl">1. Difference Between map, filter, forEach and find in JavaScript?</h2>
        <h2 class="text-2xl text-gray-500">Ans</h2>

        <h2 class="font-bold text-2xl mt-9">2. Difference Between Local Storage, Session Storage and Cookies?</h2>
        <h2 class="text-2xl text-gray-500"><span class="font-bold">Local storage:</span> It stores data on the client side and has a larger storage
            capacity than session storage or cookies. Data persists beyond the current session and can be accessed by
            any page within the same domain.

            <br><br><span class="font-bold">Session storage:</span> It also stores data on the client side, but data is only accessible during the current
            session and is deleted when the session ends. Data is not shared between different tabs or windows of the
            same domain.

            <br><br><span class="font-bold">Cookies: </span>It can store data on the client or server side and have a limit of 4 KB per cookie and 300 cookies per
            domain. They can be accessed by multiple pages and sessions and can be set to expire at a specific time.
            They are less secure than local storage and session storage.</h2>

        <h2 class="font-bold text-2xl mt-9">3. What is Event Loop in JavaScript?</h2>
        <h2 class="text-2xl text-gray-500">The event loop is a fundamental concept in JavaScript that ensures
            non-blocking execution of asynchronous tasks by constantly checking the call stack and task queue. It
            enables the program to handle multiple tasks simultaneously without getting stuck waiting for a long-running
            task to complete.</h2>

        <h2 class="font-bold text-2xl mt-9">4. Describe about <span class="text-orange-600">quizTimer()</span> Function
            used in noChange.js</h2>
        <h2 class="text-2xl text-gray-500">Basically this is a function to set a timer in second and minutes. It accepts
            a single parameter called "dismiss". It runs the code further only if the dismiss parameter is false
            otherwise clear the previous interval timer. The function sets an interval which is 1000ms.

            <br><br> It means that the count variable gets updated in every second. And based on the count variable
            value,
            and with some basic divide and modulus operation it can calculate second and store in countSec variable and
            minutes in min variable. Later on it continuously displayed on the countHtml element using some DOM
            manipulation. Also it sets different colors for different timeframe.

        <h2 class="font-bold text-2xl mt-9">4. Describe about <span class="text-orange-600">chooseQuiz()</span> Function
            used in noChange.js</h2>
        <h2 class="text-2xl text-gray-500">The purpose of this function seems to be related to selecting a quiz question
            and storing the user's answer. It accepts 2 parameters called "index" and "givenAns". The "index" parameter
            represents the index of the quiz question that the user has selected, and the "givenAns" parameter
            represents the answer that the user has given for that question.

            <br><br> The function first checks if there is an existing answer stored for the selected quiz question, and
            then
            either updates the existing answer or creates a new one in the "answers" array. Finally, the function calls
            another function named "displayAnswers" to update the display of the quiz answers.
